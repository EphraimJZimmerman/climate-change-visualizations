        "fullDescription": "The average of sea surface temperatures from 1901 to 2020 as recorded quinquennially by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Due to denser sampling and improvements in sampling design and measurement techniques, newer data are more precise than older data. The earlier trends displayed by this indicator confer less certainty due to lower sampling frequency and less precise sampling methods."
