        "fullDescription": "Average global sea surface temperature taken from the NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature dataset. Data is taken from ships, floating, and stationary bouys. As collection methods have improved considerably since the 1800s, newer data (NOAA mentions past the 1940s) is more reliable. Sea surface temperature increased during the 20th century and continues to rise. From 1901 through 2020, temperature rose at an average rate of 0.14Â°F per decade."
